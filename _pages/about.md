# About me 

I am a GNSS R&D Engineer specializing in precise positioning and navigation, with a strong focus on algorithm development and **real-time GNSS** applications. My work aims at developing reliable and high-accuracy navigation solutions for challenging environments.

I have hands-on experience in **multi-sensor fusion**, particularly GNSS/INS integration.

I received my Master of Science degree in Navigation (ESPACE) from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), with a specialization in GNSS and high-precision positioning.
